# Basic-Passport-Management-System-in-CPP
This is a CLI base Passport Management System developed solely in C++.
In this project I focus on implementation of OOP concepts. No procedural/sequential approach is used in this.


Functionalities are divided into two different roles:

	• Admin’s Functionalities: 

		Admin will be able to operate following function:

		o	Admin can see all the approved applicants.
		o	Admin can search a specific applicant.
		o	Admin can approve or reject the application.
		o	Admin can also see the list of all rejected applicants.


	• Applicant’s Functionalities:

		Applicant will be able to operate following function

		o	Applicants can apply for passport registration.
		o	Applicants can also check their application’s status (approve/rejected).

Following components or concepts of C++ programming language used in the development of this system:

• Classes
• Inheritance
• Constructor
• Destructor
• File Handling
• Header Files
• If-else Statements
• Arrays
• Loops
• User-define Function/Member Functions
• Polymorphism
• Friend Functions and Classes
• Pure Virtual Function
• Relationship between Classes
